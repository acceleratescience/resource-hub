The haystack of information hiding potentially salient needles of evidence has grown and continues to grow at an exponential rate. Although awareness of this problem is widespread, few solutions exist. AI large language models (LLMs) may offer a path forward.

However, most techniques are density dependent and do not take into account edge weights. To overcome these limitations, Muldoon et al developed the small world propensity measure in MATLAB. Modern data pipelines however, are often written in Python.

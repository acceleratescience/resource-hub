# Training

We’ve collected together some of the training courses and tutorials from the University and beyond that can help you get to grips with AI. 

To help find the training that you need, we’ve grouped by level:

- **NEWCOMER** You’re interested to learn about AI technology, but don't yet have a clear idea of how to use it. You are new to programming.
- **INTERMEDIATE** You have some AI knowledge, have some clear ideas about how to use AI in your research, and consider yourself a a beginner- to mid-level programmer.
- **PROFICIENT** You've successfully used AI in your research, are a competent programmer, and are looking to make research software and processes more scalable and efficient.

We welcome recommendations from our community, so do let us know if you come across other tutorials and courses that we ought to include here.

## Intro to AI
We have put together a short online course as an introduction to some of the core AI concepts.

| Title       | Level | Description                          | Link |
| ----------- | ----- | ------------------------------------ | ---- |
| AI Core Concepts | NEWCOMER | This short online course aims to introduce newcomers to some of the themes and concepts of AI. The goal is to help orient you in the field and signpost some next steps. | [link](https://docs.science.ai.cam.ac.uk/ai-core-concepts/) |

## Courses: Accelerate Science & Cambridge Spark
These online courses are run jointly between the Accelerate programme and Cambridge Spark, and are available for university researchers to sign up to.

| Python Programming for Science | NEWCOMER | This 1-3 day self-learning module introduces the fundamentals of Python, some of the kinds of data it can handle, and how to store that data. Designed for researchers across disciplines, it supports learners to rapidly learn how to code in the context of working with real-world data. To access the module, register at the link.  | [link](https://acceleratescience.github.io/resources/python-programming-for-science.html) |
| Data Residency | NEWCOMER | The Accelerate Programme offers PhDs and postdocs in disciplines across Cambridge University the opportunity to participate in a 5-week ‘Data for Science’ training course. This structured Accelerate-Cambridge Spark ‘Introducing Data Science for Research’ will equip scientists with modern practical data analysis skills using Python in a virtual instructor-led accelerated masterclass. | [link](https://acceleratescience.github.io/resources/introducing-data-science-for-science.html) |
| ML Academy | NEWCOMER | This 12 month introduction to Machine Learning is a structured Accelerate-Cambridge Spark course. With the fundamentals of AI and ML, and a selection of modules to choose from, the course is designed to give you the knowledge to confidently begin using ML in your work.

## Accelerate Workshops
Accelerate's 1-day workshops are created by the Accelerate Programme's Machine Learning Engineers and researchers. You can sign up to attend the workshops when we run them, or work through the online material at your own pace. 

| Title       | Level | Description                          | Link |
| ----------- | ----- | ------------------------------------ | ---- |
| AI and Large Language Models Workshop | INTERMEDIATE | A one day workshop for researchers interested in using LLMs in their research. The aim of the session will be to equip researchers with knowledge of how LLMs work and how to implement them so you can use them in your own research.  | [link](https://github.com/acceleratescience/large-language-models) |
| Diffusion Models Workshop | INTERMEDIATE | A one day workshop for researchers interested in using diffusion models in their research. The aim of the session will be to equip researchers with knowledge of how diffusion models work and how to implement them so you can use them in your own research.  | [link](https://github.com/acceleratescience/diffusion-models) |
| Data Pipelines for Science | INTERMEDIATE | Well-curated and managed data is central to the effective use of AI, in science and elsewhere. How can scientists build the data pipelines they need to accelerate their research with AI? Accelerate Science’s ‘Data Pipelines for Science’ School helps scientists overcome such data pipeline challenges by equipping them with the latest best-practice software techniques.  | [link](https://github.com/acceleratescience/data-school-Spring23) |
| Publishing and Packaging Python Code | INTERMEDIATE | The Accelerate Programme's one day workshop to equip researchers with knowledge of workflows and tools they can use to package and publish their code. Participants will have the opportunity for hands on experience packaging and publishing a project. | [link](https://github.com/acceleratescience/packaging-publishing) |


## University Courses
Other AI-related courses taught within the university

| Title       | Level | Description                          | Link |
| ----------- | ----- | ------------------------------------ | ---- |
| ML and Adaptive Intelligence | NEWCOMER | This course - Machine Learning and Adaptive Intelligence - was originally delivered at the University of Sheffield (2011-2015), but has been updated with current material to introduce key concepts and methods in machine learning.  | [link](https://mlatcl.github.io/mlai/) |
| Advanced Data Science | INTERMEDIATE | This course - Advanced Data Science - looks at the real world challenges of data science, separating them into three stages: access, assess and address. The stages help in understanding that the data science pipeline is not just about the machine learning methods, but the ethical concerns, the challenges of data management as well as model fitting. | [link](https://mlatcl.github.io/advds/) |
| Data Visualisation | INTERMEDIATE | This lecture on data visualisation, together with code, can help you understand the different ways to look at data and to effectively showcase your research results.  | [link](https://github.com/neelsoumya/visualization_lecture) |
| Machine Learning and the Physical World | PROFICIENT | This course - Machine Learning and the Physical World - is focused on how to build machine learning systems that interact directly with the real world. It explores how to create models with a principled treatment of uncertainty, allowing researchers to leverage prior knowledge and provide decisions that can be interrogated.  | [link](https://mlatcl.github.io/mlphysical/) |
| Theory of Deep Learning | PROFICIENT | The objective of this course is to expose you to one of the most active contemporary research directions within machine learning: the theory of deep learning (DL). While the first wave of modern DL focussed on empirical breakthroughs and ever more complex techniques, attention is now shifting to building a solid mathematical understanding of why these techniques work so well in the first place. | [link](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/teaching/2324/R252/) |

# Training

We’ve collected together some of the training courses and tutorials from the University and beyond that can help you get to grips with AI. 

To help find the training that you need, we’ve grouped by level:

- **NEWCOMER** You’re interested to learn about AI technology, but don't yet have a clear idea of how to use it. You are new to programming.
- **INTERMEDIATE** You have some AI knowledge, have some clear ideas about how to use AI in your research, and consider yourself a beginner- to mid-level programmer.
- **PROFICIENT** You've successfully used AI in your research, are a competent programmer, and are looking to make research software and processes more scalable and efficient.

We welcome recommendations from our community, so do let us know if you come across other tutorials and courses that we ought to include here.

## University Courses
Other AI-related courses taught within the university

<div class="grid cards newcomer" markdown>

-   [__ML and Adaptive Intelligence__](https://mlatcl.github.io/mlai/)<br>`NEWCOMER`

    ---
    This course was originally delivered at the University of Sheffield (2011-2015), but has been updated with current material to introduce key concepts and methods in machine learning.

</div>

<div class="grid cards intermediate" markdown>

-   [__Advanced Data Science__](https://mlatcl.github.io/advds/)<br>`INTERMEDIATE`

    ---
    This course looks at the real world challenges of data science, separating them into three stages: access, assess and address. The stages help in understanding that the data science pipeline is not just about the machine learning methods, but the ethical concerns, the challenges of data management as well as model fitting.


-   [__Data Visualisation__](https://github.com/neelsoumya/visualization_lecture)<br>`INTERMEDIATE`

    ---
    This lecture on data visualisation, together with code, can help you understand the different ways to look at data and to effectively showcase your research results.

    Our AI Clinic is the easiest way to ask us for help, by sending us a ticket about your issue. We'll get back to you with a time to talk through your issue. Our tickets range from help with conceptual ideas and proposal writing through to software help and debugging. File a ticket [here](https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=RQSlSfq9eUut41R7TzmG6SaVOxbmBOdAg9GzbnrB5IRUNDhIUjNCRkI0SjFaV1Y2VDRTR1pPWTNKOS4u).

    We're building a library of software that you can use to get started quickly with the latest AI models. This typically comes out of our training courses and workshops, but you can use the code with or without attending the training courses:
    
    [Data Pipelines](https://github.com/acceleratescience/data-school-Spring23)
    
    [LLM Toolkit](https://github.com/acceleratescience/large-language-models)

    [Diffusion Model Toolkit](https://github.com/acceleratescience/diffusion-models)

    [Publishing and Packaging](https://github.com/acceleratescience/packaging-publishing)

    Our work across the university has led to the release of open source software for the different research projects, e.g.
    
    [Netts - a project for visualising topics in a conversation](https://pypi.org/project/netts/0.2.0rc1/)

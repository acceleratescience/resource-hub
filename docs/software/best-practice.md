# Some Software Best Practices

To help you get started with available computing resources and Software Engineering best practices, we’ve collected some resources. 

First and foremost, AI can be compute-intensive! We highly recommend using the **University’s High Performance Computing (HPC)** cluster when you need computing power. You can find some getting-started instructions:

- [HPC Documentation](https://docs.hpc.cam.ac.uk/hpc/user-guide/mfa.html#walkthrough-ssh-to-multi-hpc-cam-ac-uk)
- [HPC Access Application Form](https://www.hpc.cam.ac.uk/rcs-application)
- [Usage allocations](https://docs.hpc.cam.ac.uk/hpc/user-guide/policies.html#service-level-3-free-usage)

The Bioinformatics department have created a comprehensive [introduction to using the HPC](https://bioinfotraining.bio.cam.ac.uk/postgraduate/basic-skills-and-programming).


**Managing experimentation** can become cumbersome as you start to use different models and datasets. Weights & Biases or MLflow are platforms that allow you to track ML experiments. As you move to using AI in your own domains, these platforms can make your life easier:

**Version control** is a key part of the workflow for anyone writing software, to manage and track the code changes that you’re making. GitHub is a widely used version control tool, and their documentation can help you get started:

# Community

**We are building a community of AI researchers across the university, and we'd love for you to join us.**

As AI is adopted across disciplines, scientists face challenges understanding and implementing this new technology. We are building a community of researchers working at the interface of AI and the sciences. To date, over 750 researchers from more than 80 Departments at the University have engaged with the programme to share knowledge and experience.

    Our AI Cafe is an in-person drop-in session, with experts from the Accelerate programme there to answer questions. We have run these in colleges, departments and other university locations. If you'd like to host an AI cafe, let us know!

## Events

We run a range of events for researchers working to apply AI in their research. These are open to anyone across the university who has an interest in being part of our community. 

We also run workshops, training courses and study groups to convene smaller groups and have a more in-depth discussion.

## Seminars

We run a seminar series in the Department of Computer Sciences, with talks from our community around the University. At these seminars, researchers present short talks on their work at the interface of AI and the sciences. [Sign up to attend](https://talks.cam.ac.uk/show/index/112540){ target="_blank" } the next sessions and let us know if you would like to present at a future seminar.
